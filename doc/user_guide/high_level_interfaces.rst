EQTK high level interfaces
==========================


EQTK offers three high-level interfaces for solving couple equilibria.

- `eqtk.solve() <eqtk_solve>`_ This is EQTK's main high level interface; typically all calculations use this function.
- `eqtk.fixed_value_solve() <eqtk_fixed_value_solve>`_ This utility allows for solving equilibria where the concentration(s) of one or more species is fixed.
- `eqtk.volumetric_titration() <eqtk_volumetric_titration>`_ This utility allows for computing titration curves as a function of volume of added titrant.
